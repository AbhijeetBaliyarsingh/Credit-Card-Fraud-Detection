Credit Card Fraud Detection and Prediction using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Techniques
# Abstract
Credit Card fraud detection is a growing problem, with major financial institutions losing millions of dollars in fraud every year. Credit card companies are using various techniques to detect fraudulent credit card charges, including pattern matching and neural network models (e.g., logistic regression, random forests). However, these approaches have limitations - they require enormous amounts of training data and can be computationally expensive.

Despite developing advanced technologies to prevent fraud, such as the use of chip and pin verification, 3-D Secure for online transactions and security questions for internet banking, traditional machine learning models used to automate detection of fraud are inadequate, as they fail to predict whether a transaction is fraudulent or not for the following reasons: 
 - Fraudsters invent new fraud patterns and continuously change their strategies to avoid being detected.
 - Machine learning models that are never updated are inadequate as they do not adapt to new fraud strategies.
 - Static machine learning models do not take account of changes and trends in consumer spending behaviour, for example during holiday seasons and geographical regions.

In these situations, the implementation of an accurate fraud detection system that adapts to new fraud behaviours and evolves continuously is of crucial importance for financial institutions in order to prevent fraud before it occurs, protect consumersâ€™ interests, and reduce the damages caused by fraud.

Having worked in the BFSI sector for over ten years, I have noticed how banks and financial institutions face serious problems related to credit card fraud. After doing extensive research and reviewing multiple articles as well as research papers in the fraud detection space, I observed that most studies have focused on the use of machine learning methods for supervised learning and unsupervised learning. However, recent studies indicate a trend towards using hybrid methods of the former two types to combine their advantages. This project discusses a number of methods used in fraud detection, the most important traditional methods such as algorithms for optimization and machine learning as well as neural networks. 


While traditional Machine Learning (ML) based techniques have the potential to evolve and detect previously unseen patterns of fraud, they do not consider fraud sequences or behaviour changes which may lead to false alarms. In this project, we develop a credit card fraud detection system that apply multiple conventional ML techniques like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Classifier with RBF kernel as well Deep Learning techniques such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Attention based Neural Networks and Autoencoders as a sequence learner to include transaction sequences. The proposed approach aims to capture the historic purchase behaviour of credit card holders with the goal of improving fraud detection accuracy on new incoming transactions. Experiments show that our proposed model gives strong results, and its accuracy is quite high.

In this project, we propose a credit card fraud detection system based on conventional machine learning techniques as well as Deep Learning algorithms to predict the fraudulent behaviour of credit card transactions and deliver good fraud detection performance. We provide the experimental results to validate the effectiveness of our approach.
